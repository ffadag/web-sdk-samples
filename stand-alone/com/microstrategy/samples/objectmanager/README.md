# Object Manager Packages

Object Manager packages can be created using the Web SDK using the WebSourceManipulator class.

> Note: object manager may automate some aspects of package-creation, such as dependency fetching, which may need to be done by the developer to programmatically achieve the same behaviour.

Some parameters, such as the "localFolderPath", may need to be changed to use this sample.
